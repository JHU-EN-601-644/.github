## EN 601.644/444 Medical Device Cybersecurity Course Projects

The course [EN.601.444/644](https://isi.jhu.edu/academics/program-requirements-2/mssi-course-distribution/) and [EP.695.74](https://ep.jhu.edu/courses/695724-medical-device-security/) Medical Device Cybersecurity offers a comprehensive examination of the FDA's final cybersecurity guidance for premarket submissions and postmarket activities, emphasizing its requirements and the practical application of processes to achieve compliance.

Students will gain a deep understanding of how these guidelines influence the development of medical devices, spanning the entire lifecycle from initial design and development to final deployment. The curriculum emphasizes methodologies required to meet these standards, focusing on applying threat modeling, conducting cybersecurity risk assessments, and performing penetration testing adapted to clinical environments.

This course employs real-world case studies, practical exercises, and hands-on simulations to bridge theory and application. Students will also be assigned a course-long project in which they design and develop a medical device prototype from inception, integrating robust cybersecurity measures throughout the development process.
